    'description': '''
This module modifies the operation of the manufacturing so that, if a
production lot is introduced for the product to be manufactured, instead of
creating a move with that same production lot, a move is created for each unit
and an unique production lot is assigned to it, it is created from the name of
the selected production lot by adding an incremental sequence. In this way
each manufactured product will have a unique lot.

If the quantity to be manufactured contains decimals, a move will be made per
unit assigning a single lot to each one less the last one that will have as a
quantity one unit plus the decimal part, also with a single lot.''',
