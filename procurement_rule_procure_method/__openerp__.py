    'description': '''
Add a new procure method 'MTS + MTO' to be selected in the procurement rules so
that, when a stock move is confirmed, it is checked if it is reserved in some
quant. If it is, will change the procure method to 'make_to_stock'. Otherwise,
will change it to 'make_to_order' and reconfirm the move so that the purchase
is created.''',
