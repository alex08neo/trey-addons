"If you use payment terms, the due date will be computed automatically at the "
"generation of accounting entries. The payment term may compute several due "
"dates, for example 50% now and 50% in one month, but if you want to force a "
"due date, make sure that the payment term is not set on the invoice. If you "
"keep the payment term and the due date empty, it means direct payment."
